## New TV

Pulls in lists of upcoming TV shows through the [TVRage API](http://services.tvrage.com/info.php?page=main).

### To Do
	
- ability to delete shows (include button in "edit" popup)
- cache shows daily
- add button per show to display all episodes (in case one was missed)
- set apart far future shows (if they won't air for another few months, like Dexter right now)

### Maybes

- highlight shows airing today
- load episodes for newly added shows with ajax
- when show is recently aired, order it by upcoming show, not recently aired show
- degrade gracefully without javascript
